The closer $h$ is to $h^*$, the more informed the heuristic will be. But be careful, because providing information with $h$ can be much more computationally expensive than a less informed heuristic (e.g., $h(S_{N-1}) = 0$). If we do a lot of computations to find $h(S_{N-1})$, then the heuristic will be slower. We need to find a balance between how informed and how fast our heuristic is.\n",

    "- This config prioritizes exploration and solution stability over execution speed. With a large population size (pop_size=200), extended evolution (max_gen=150), and strong elitism (5 individuals), it significantly increases computational cost. For simpler problems (P0, P1, P2), the algorithm consistently finds the optimal 5-color solutions. On more complex problems (P3, P4), the larger population helps stabilize results: P3 mostly converges to 5–6 colors, while P4 consistently finds 7-color solutions.\n",

    "- Both A* and Genetic Algorithm successfully solve the graph coloring problem, but they have advantages and disadvantages.\n",

    "- A* guarantees optimal solutions when using admissible heuristics, but the execution time varies drastically depending on the problem and heuristic. For large or complex graphs (P4), even a well-informed heuristic can take significantly longer, while for smaller problems, it is extremely fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Genetic Algorithm provides a stochastic approach, switching strict optimality with flexibility. By tuning/modifying population size, mutation rate, and elitism, the algorithm can quickly find good solutions across all problems, with more consistent performance for harder graphs (P3, P4). However, it requires careful configuration to balance exploration and speed.\n",
